# Weighted Spin-the-Wheel HTML Project

A small front-end project built as a commission for a Discord community.

## Description
This project implements a weighted spin-the-wheel game using a simple HTML interface.  

- The wheel takes input from a Google Form, which stores responses in a Google Sheet.  
- The results are used to determine the outcome of the spin, allowing certain options to have higher probability than others.  
- Includes a custom background image and font for styling.  

This project demonstrates basic web interactivity, input handling, and front-end design in a compact, functional web page.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (inline or `<style>` tag)
